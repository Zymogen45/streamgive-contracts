# Contract events

Every event published by the contracts in this repo, with its topics and
data shape, so an indexer can be written directly against this repo without
going to `streamgive-docs` first.

Soroban events have two parts:

- **Topics** — a tuple, always starting with a `Symbol` naming the event.
  Topics are indexed/filterable.
- **Data** — the event payload. Shown below as the Rust type(s) passed to
  `env.events().publish((topics...), data)`. A single value publishes as
  itself; a tuple of values publishes as an XDR array in that order.

`Address`, `i128`, `u64`, `u32`, `bool`, and `String` are the standard
Soroban SDK/XDR types (`Address` is the SDK's account/contract address
type, `String` is `soroban_sdk::String`).

## `ngo-registry`

### `register`

Emitted by `register` when an NGO submits an application.

| | |
|---|---|
| Topics | `("register", owner: Address)` |
| Data | `name: String` |

The entry starts unverified (`verified: false`); look for a matching
`approved` event for the same `owner` to know when it's live.

### `renamed`

Emitted by `update_name` when an NGO changes the name on its application
before it has been approved.

| | |
|---|---|
| Topics | `("renamed", owner: Address)` |
| Data | `name: String` (the new name) |

Once an `approved` event has been seen for an `owner`, no further
`renamed` events can follow for it while it stays verified.

### `approved`

Emitted by `approve_ngo` when an admin marks a registered NGO as verified.

| | |
|---|---|
| Topics | `("approved", ngo_owner: Address)` |
| Data | `()` (no payload) |

### `revoked`

Emitted by `revoke_ngo` when an admin reverses a prior approval, marking a
verified NGO as unverified again. This is the direct counterpart to
`approved` for the same `ngo_owner` — an indexer should treat a `revoked`
event as cancelling the most recent `approved` event for that address.

| | |
|---|---|
| Topics | `("revoked", ngo_owner: Address)` |
| Data | `()` (no payload) |

## `donation-vault`

### `propadmin`

Emitted by `propose_admin` when the current admin nominates a new admin.
The transfer is not complete until the nominated address calls
`accept_admin` and an `acptadmin` event is emitted.

| | |
|---|---|
| Topics | `("propadmin",)` |
| Data | `new_admin: Address` |

### `acptadmin`

Emitted by `accept_admin` when the nominated admin accepts the transfer.
After this event the address in `data` is the active admin; the previous
admin has no further authority.

| | |
|---|---|
| Topics | `("acptadmin",)` |
| Data | `new_admin: Address` |

### `pause`

Emitted by `pause` when an admin halts stream creation, withdrawal, top-up,
and rate changes.

| | |
|---|---|
| Topics | `("pause",)` |
| Data | `()` (no payload) |

### `unpause`

Emitted by `unpause` when an admin lifts a pause.

| | |
|---|---|
| Topics | `("unpause",)` |
| Data | `()` (no payload) |

### `created`

Emitted by `create_stream` when a donor opens a new stream.

| | |
|---|---|
| Topics | `("created", stream_id: u64)` |
| Data | `(donor: Address, ngo: Address, token: Address, deposit: i128, rate: i128)` |

`deposit` is the amount pulled from the donor into the vault; `rate` is how
much of it accrues to the NGO per second (see [`math::accrued`](../contracts/donation-vault/src/math.rs)).

### `withdraw`

Emitted by `withdraw` when an NGO claims everything accrued on a stream
since the last checkpoint.

| | |
|---|---|
| Topics | `("withdraw", stream_id: u64)` |
| Data | `accrued: i128` |

`accrued` is the gross amount released from the stream's balance — if a
protocol fee is configured (see `set_fee_bps`/`set_treasury`), the NGO
actually receives `accrued` minus the fee, with the fee paid to the
treasury in the same transaction. No separate fee event is emitted; derive
the split from the vault's `fee_bps()`/`treasury()` at the time of the
transaction.

### `cancel`

Emitted by `cancel_stream` when a donor stops a stream for good.

| | |
|---|---|
| Topics | `("cancel", stream_id: u64)` |
| Data | `(accrued: i128, refund: i128)` |

`accrued` is whatever had accrued to the NGO and was paid out (subject to
the same protocol-fee split as `withdraw`) as part of settling the stream;
`refund` is the untouched remainder returned to the donor. The stream
record is kept with `balance` and `rate` zeroed, not deleted.

### `topup`

Emitted by `top_up` when a donor adds more funds to an existing stream.

| | |
|---|---|
| Topics | `("topup", stream_id: u64)` |
| Data | `amount: i128` |

`amount` is only the newly added deposit. Any balance already accrued at
the time of the top-up is settled to the NGO first (as its own implicit
payout, without emitting a `withdraw` event) before the deposit is added.

### `ratemod`

Emitted by `modify_rate` when a donor changes a stream's per-second accrual
rate.

| | |
|---|---|
| Topics | `("ratemod", stream_id: u64)` |
| Data | `new_rate: i128` |

As with `top_up`, any balance already accrued at the old rate is settled to
the NGO first, so the new rate only ever applies going forward.
